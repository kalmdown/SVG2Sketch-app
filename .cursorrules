# Debugging Session Rules

## Problem Tracking
- When I say something "isn't working" or report an error, explicitly restate the problem before suggesting solutions
- Label the current problem status: [ACTIVE], [TESTING], [RESOLVED]
- Never suggest the same approach twice - check conversation history first

## Code Suggestions
- Always provide COMPLETE, runnable code blocks (not fragments or "// rest of code" comments)
- Label each code block with intent: [NEW APPROACH], [MODIFICATION], [DEBUGGING]
- Include file paths in comments at the top of each code block
- After suggesting code, ask: "What errors or output did you get?"

## Failed Attempts
- When I report that code didn't work, explicitly log it as:
```
  FAILED: [brief description]
  Reason: [why it failed based on my feedback]
```
- Before suggesting new code, state: "Previous attempt failed because X, so trying Y instead"

## File Context
- Always mention which files are being modified/created
- Use consistent file path format: `src/path/to/file.ts`
- When referencing multiple files, list them at the start of the response

## Error Handling
- When I paste error messages, extract the key failure point first
- Ask clarifying questions about the error before suggesting fixes
- Don't assume - if the error could have multiple causes, ask which

## Response Structure
Use this format for complex debugging:
```
CURRENT PROBLEM:
[Clear statement]

FILES INVOLVED:
- file1.ts
- file2.ts

WHAT WE'VE TRIED:
- Attempt 1: [what] → [result]
- Attempt 2: [what] → [result]

NEW APPROACH:
[Why this is different]
[Code block with full implementation]

NEXT STEPS:
[What to test, what output to look for]
```

## Efficiency
- Don't repeat working code unless it needs modification
- Use diffs for small changes instead of full file rewrites
- Consolidate related changes into single responses
